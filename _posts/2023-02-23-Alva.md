The brief for this brand new house and garden was to create a garden for socialising, which maximised the view of the hills, provided pollinator friendly planting, space for the hot tub and space to grow some vegetables.

This geometric design was about maximising the view from the house to the garden and from the garden to the hills, utilities were located in the side passage, in the centre of the garden is a large sociable patio, looking onto the views and connecting to the hot tub area.
